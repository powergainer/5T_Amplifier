# Slew Rate of single stage amplifier

## Slew Rate

Slew rate is **the maximum rate of change that you can get on the output**.

If you apply **a large enough voltage STEP at the input, large enough that it saturates the diff pair, i.e. all the current goes to one branch while the other is dry**, then the current Io will flow to the output, charging the output cap C up at a constant current of Io, so **the voltage will rise with a slope of Io/C**.

ThatÂ´s the Slew Rate.

For this op amp, both the rising and falling Slew Rates are the same and equal to Io/C.

An extra note on Slew Rate:
